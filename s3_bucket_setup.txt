S3 Bucket Setup Instructions:

1. Create an S3 bucket in your AWS account.  Choose a unique name for your bucket (e.g., "log-analytics-yourname").
2. Create two folders inside the bucket:
    - raw_logs: This folder will store the raw log data ingested from Kinesis.
    - aggregated_logs: This folder will store the aggregated log data processed by PySpark.
3.  Ensure that your AWS credentials are configured correctly to allow Kinesis and PySpark to access the S3 bucket.  This typically involves setting up IAM roles with the necessary permissions.
